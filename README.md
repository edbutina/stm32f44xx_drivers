#stm32f44xx_drivers

This is a practice project to strengthen my embedded programming skills. My dev environment is STM32CubeIDE running in a Ubuntu 18.04 VM.
I'm following the "Mastering Microcontroller with Embedded Driver Development"
course on UDEMY.  I left off at video 94, in the function implementation .c file.
